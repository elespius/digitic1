      | condo |
      | house |
    And I am logged in as "kassi_testperson2"
    And "kassi_testperson2" has admin rights in community "test"
    And community "test" has custom fields enabled
    And I am on the custom fields admin page
    Then I should see that there is a custom field "House type"
